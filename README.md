# Unibo Computer Science - Year 2 Projects

This repository contains my projects, assignments, and exercises from the second year of the Computer Science and Engineering program at the University of Bologna (UNIBO).

## Courses & Projects

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* **Description:** Projects and exercises focused on object-oriented design principles and software development.

* **Topics:** Java, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, design patterns, concurrent programming, and GUI development.

* **Repository** Folder: `OOP`

### 2. Operating Systems
* **Description:** Assignments and projects exploring the fundamental concepts and implementation of modern operating systems.

* **Topics:** C programming, shell scripting, process and thread management, CPU scheduling, synchronization (mutexes, semaphores), virtual memory management, and file systems.

### 3. Numerical Calculus and Machine Learning
* **Description:** Projects and exercises focusing on numerical analysis, computational mathematics, and the mathematical foundations of Artificial Intelligence.

* **Topics:** Floating-point arithmetic and error analysis, root-finding algorithms (Newton-Raphson), linear systems (direct/iterative methods, LU, QR, SVD factorizations), least squares, interpolation, and numerical integration. Introduction to AI: Neural Networks (MLP, CNN), forward/backward propagation, and loss function optimization (Gradient Descent, Adam, RMSProp).
